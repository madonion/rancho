            <p>Rancho del Inglés is the perfect place to enjoy your wedding in Spain. There are no packages or deals, only our commitment to delivering exactly what you want on your most special day.</p>
            <p>Celebrate your marriage with a blessing here at the casa or simply return here after your religious ceremony in the stunning local church, located in our local town of Alhaurín de la Torre. Then dine and dance the night away under the Andalucian stars.</p>
            <p>We can host up to 200 people (in summer). Please email or call us to request a copy of our detailed wedding information pack and, of course, to organise a chat with our general manager who will oversee your event from beginning to end.</p>
