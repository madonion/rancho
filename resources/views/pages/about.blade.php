        <p>David and Miyuki have transformed their rambling ranch into an exciting enterprise and happy place to stay. While the farmhouse dates from the 1860s the rest is a cornucopia of building materials salvaged from Europe and Asia, resulting in a delightful fusion of architectural styles.</p>

        <p>Spaces are furnished with fascinating pieces: a shelving unit from a Surrey post office, an ancient Salamanca door, a raised-iron Punjabi bed... there's even a shower room open to the skies.</p>

        <p>No two rooms are alike and yet there are constants, in the beautiful barro tiles, the arched shuttered windows, the delicate balconies. Hot water in the main house is solar-heated, while living areas have log-burning stoves and huge dining tables; loggias have space and views; citrus trees glisten in the sun.</p>
